# eCommerce Catalog

Define your own custom catalog and how it interacts with the eCommerce purchase flow in a way that is not currently supported natively by Wix. You're not limited to the way Wix business apps, such as Wix Stores and Wix Bookings, define their respective catalogs of products and services. For example, you can define the number of catalogs to choose from, provide a simplified catalog of products/services, and define the products/services you wish to sell.
