# eCommerce Catalog

With eCommerce Catalog SPIs, you can define your own catalog and the way it interacts with the Wix eCommerce purchase flow. This means you're not limited to the existing way business apps, such as Wix Stores and Wix Bookings, define their respective catalogs of products and services. 

For example, you can avoid limitations, such as the number of catalogs to choose from and how you define the products and services you wish to sell. 

With this Velo SPI, you can describe your product in a way that is not currently supported natively, or create a simplified catalog of services.
