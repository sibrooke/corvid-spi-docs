# Overview

Corvid’s SPIs enable you to extend Corvid’s functionality so that you can integrate external services with your Wix site. Use the SPIs to build your endpoints so that your Wix site and your external services can communicate seamlessly.

To use the SPIs, you’ll need a working knowledge of JavaScript, as well as your external service’s APIs.
