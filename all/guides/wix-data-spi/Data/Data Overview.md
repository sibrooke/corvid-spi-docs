# Data Overview
The External Database Collections SPI describes the API requests your SPI needs to expect from your Wix site and the responses your Wix site expects in return. The SPI takes the request from your Wix site and converts it into something your external database can receive. It also takes the response from the external database and converts into something your Wix site can receive.

You can learn more about working with External Databases on your Wix site [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/working-with-external-database-collections).


The  **Data**  SPI describes the payloads for data API requests to your external database and the payloads for their success and failure responses. Data API requests occur whenever your site needs to interact with the data in your external collection.
